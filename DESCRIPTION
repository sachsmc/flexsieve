Description: A unified framework for simultaneously assessing CoP and sieve effects of a vaccine in 
    a large Phase III randomized trial. We use flexible parametric models treating times to infection from 
    different agents as competing risks and estimated maximum likelihood to fit the models. The parametric 
    models under competing risks allow for estimation of both cumulative incidence based contrasts, and 
    instantaneous rates. We outline the assumptions with which we can link the estimands to the causal 
    contrasts of interest, propose hypothesis testing procedures, and evaluate our proposed methods 
    in an extensive simulation study.
